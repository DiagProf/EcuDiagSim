# Privacy and Permissions Overview for EcuDiagSim

EcuDiagSim places the utmost importance on your privacy. **The application does not collect, store, or share any personal information.** It also does not access your contacts or any other personal data stored on your device.

## Why Full Permissions are Essential

EcuDiagSim utilizes a Vehicle Communication Interface (VCI) with the D-PDU API interface for vehicle diagnostics. To ensure effective operation, it requires access to a native DLL, which in turn necessitates full application permissions. These permissions are solely used to enable the appâ€™s diagnostic functionalities.
